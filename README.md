# OBST
    
## CONSOLE APPLICATION : OBST Project Overview

This program runs best with a 64-bit processor as opposed to 32-bit. 
Sometimes the program will crash when the number of inputs is large
with a 32-bit processor. 

In order for this program to run faster, you can run it in release mode
in Visual Studio, as opposed to debug mode.
